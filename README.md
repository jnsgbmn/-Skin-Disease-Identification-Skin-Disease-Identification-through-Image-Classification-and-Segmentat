## Features
- We use Architecture of ResNet-152 in this study. ResNet-152 is a type of neural network architecture used for image classification containing 152 layers.And we use Gaussian Noise applied in an Image.

- Image augmentation is a technique that is used in computer vision to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by generating variations of existing images.The purpose of this technique is to enhance the diversity of the images used to train models in machine learning, which can lead to a better generalization on new, and unseen data.

- The system has a feature that utilizes the Global Viral skin diseases dataset from Kaggle for the purpose of analyzing cases. These datasets are displayed using an open-source library called plotly.js, which can be visualized in Jupiter notebook and integrated into the server.

- the WHOâ€™s Viral Skin Diseases Analysis Cases, an HTML iframe element tag that embeds and interactive chart or table from the website ourworldindata.org. The chart is related to viral disease cases today and displays confirmed cases data over time, with options to filter by various metrics such as frequency and relative population.
