# Feature Extraction
This involved creating two separate files: one for the dataset itself and another for labels. The dataset CSV file lists all the images in the skin diseases dataset along with their file paths and any additional relevant metadata.we created data loaders for the training dataset to label groups of pixels of each image. Identification of the infected area helped the developed model to ease the prediction of the classifier to find the disease.![image](https://github.com/jnsgbmn/-Skin-Disease-Identification-Skin-Disease-Identification-through-Image-Classification-and-Segmentat/assets/102467227/cd60cace-1607-4fbe-a5c5-6666c9d1ddc6)

# Analysis Cases
The system has a feature that utilizes the Global Viral skin diseases dataset from Kaggle for the purpose of analyzing cases. These datasets are displayed using an open-source library called plotly.js, which can be visualized in Jupiter notebook and integrated into the server.
